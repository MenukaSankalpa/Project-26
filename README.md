A To-Do List app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript lets users add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. JavaScript handles task management, while CSS styles the user interface for a clean and responsive experience. The app provides a simple, interactive way to organize and track daily tasks efficiently.
